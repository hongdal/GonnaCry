# What's a Ransomware?

A ransomware is a form of malware that prevent legitimate users from accessing
their device or data and asks for a payment in exchange for the stolen functionality.
They have been used for mass extortion in various forms, but the
most successful seem to be encrypting ransomware: most of the user data are
encrypted and the key can be retrieved with a payment to the attacker.
To be widely successful a ransomware must fulfill three properties:

**Property 1**: The hostile binary code must not contain any secret (e.g. deciphering
keys). At least not in an easily retrievable form, indeed white box cryptography
can be applied to ransomware.

**Property 2**: Only the author of the attack should be able to decrypt the
infected device.

**Property 3**: Decrypting one device can not provide any useful information
for other infected devices, in particular the key must not be shared among them.

# Objectives:
The general objective is to encrypt the files and get it back securily.
